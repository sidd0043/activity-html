    <p>A World Cup win with Argentina in 2014 could be crucial to Lionel Messi's chances of winning back the FIFA Ballon D'Or.</p>
     
     <p> When the Argentine magician won his fourth straight Ballon D'Or award in 2012, it seemed as though we would be watching him shuffle up to collect the trophy in a garish suit for the next decade or so.</p>
     
     <p> When Messi is healthy and in-form (and if he is healthy, he is rarely out of form), not even the magnificent Cristiano Ronaldo can match his impact on the pitch.</p>
     
    <p> But injuries caught up with little Lionel in 2013, disrupting his season and ensuring his statistics were slightly less impressive than in previous years.</p>
     
     <p> A 75 percent effective Messi would normally be enough to secure the Ballon D'Or, but his injuries woes coincided with a hugely impressive individual performance over the course of the season by Ronaldo, who refused to let the prize slip away for a fifth year in a row.</p>
